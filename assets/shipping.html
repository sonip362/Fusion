        <h1><strong>Shipping & Returns</strong></h1>
        </div>
        <p>Fusion processes and ships all orders with speed, accuracy, and accountability. Orders are typically
            dispatched within 1–3 business days after successful payment confirmation. Once shipped, delivery timelines
            depend on the customer’s location and courier partner, but most domestic orders are delivered within 3–7
            business days. International shipping timelines, where applicable, may vary due to customs clearance and
            local logistics. Customers receive tracking details as soon as the order is dispatched, and it is their
            responsibility to monitor shipment progress using the provided tracking link.

            Shipping charges, if applicable, are clearly displayed at checkout. Fusion does not believe in hidden costs.
            Any delays caused by incorrect address details, failed delivery attempts, or customs-related issues are
            outside Fusion’s control, and the brand will not be held responsible for such delays. Customers are expected
            to ensure that their shipping information is accurate and complete at the time of placing the order. Orders
            once shipped cannot be redirected or modified.

            Fusion maintains strict quality control standards, and every product is inspected before dispatch. However,
            if a customer receives a product that is damaged, defective, or incorrect, they must notify Fusion within 48
            hours of delivery with clear photographic evidence. Claims made after this window will not be accepted under
            any circumstances. Upon verification, Fusion will offer a replacement or store credit, depending on product
            availability. Refunds are only issued in rare cases where replacement is not possible.

            Returns are accepted only if explicitly stated on the product page. Many Fusion products are limited,
            custom-made, or hygiene-sensitive, and therefore not eligible for return. If a return is approved, the
            product must be unused, unwashed, and returned in its original condition with all tags and packaging intact.
            Any sign of wear, damage, or misuse will result in immediate rejection of the return request. Return
            shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer unless the return is due to a verified error on
            Fusion’s part.

            Fusion does not accept returns or refunds for issues related to sizing preferences, color expectations based
            on screen differences, or change of mind after purchase. Size guides and product descriptions are provided
            clearly to help customers make informed decisions, and it is the customer’s responsibility to review them
            before ordering. Abuse of the return policy, repeated claims, or suspicious activity may result in future
            orders being restricted or cancelled without notice.

            By placing an order on the Fusion website, customers agree to all shipping and return terms outlined above.
            These policies are designed to protect both the customer and the brand, ensuring fairness, transparency, and
            operational efficiency. For any questions not covered here, customers are encouraged to contact Fusion
            support before placing an order, not after</p>
